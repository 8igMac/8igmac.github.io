solve bioinformatic problem (e.g., sequence alignment,
genome indexing).
  - Developed a alignment-based [plagiarism detection service](https://8igmac.github.io/projects/save/)
  and which later resulted in an [IEEE paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10198547) and a [startup](https://www.linkedin.com/company/praexisio/).
